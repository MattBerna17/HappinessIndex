# HappinessIndex
Inspired by the Kaggle dataset [Happiness Index in 2018 and 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sougatapramanick/happiness-index-2018-2019), this Python notebook analyzes the dataset and creates a regression model to predict the score for other values.

## About the script

I made this project to practice with Data analysis and Machine Learning using only Python 3.9 and some libraries.



## Prerequisites
To run the script you need the following:

- A web browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Edge, ...);
- A Google Colab account. 



## Installation
Now you can clone my repository
```
git clone https://github.com/MattBerna17/HappinessIndex.git
```

Open Google Colab, create a new repository and click on "File" ==> "Import notebook", then select the file .ipynb



## Running the script
You can run the script by clicking the "Run all" button in Google Colab.
